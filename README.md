I'm Yuxiang Yang, Gabriel, currently learning Javascript, Go and Python.  
I'm looking forward to find a friend that learn these with me.  
I believe Computer Science would be a beneficial tool for me to solve many problems and it has solved many of them!  
I enjoy classical, pop, and soft rock music.   
You can alway reach me by my personal email Gabrrie1@outlook.com
